# Where's The Food
A web application which helps users in Singapore to find nearby eateries as well as eateries with special discounts, developed for the HackNTU hackathon in March 2019.

The application has a map view which shows the location of all eateries with discounts, and also shows nearby eateries if the user inputs a location.

The data for discounted foods was obtained from the [KiasuFoodies Telegram channel](t.me/kiasufoodies).
