# Where's The Food
A web application which helps users in Singapore to find nearby eateries as well as eateries with special discounts. This was developed together with [gjiayi](https://github.com/gjiayi), [rgan19](https://github.com/rgan19), and [f0urseas0ns](https://github.com/f0urseas0ns) for the HackNTU hackathon in March 2019.

The application has a map view which shows the location of all eateries with discounts, and also shows nearby eateries if the user inputs a location.

The data for discounted foods was obtained from the [KiasuFoodies Telegram channel](t.me/kiasufoodies).

The app can be accessed at https://wheresthefood.herokuapp.com/
